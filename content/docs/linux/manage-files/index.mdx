## Goal

Copy, move, create, delete, and organize files from the Bash shell.

## Objectives

- Describe how Linux organizes files, and the purposes of various directories in the file-system hierarchy.
- Specify the absolute location and relative location of files to the current working directory, determine and change the working directory, and list the contents of directories.
- Create, copy, move, and remove files and directories.
- Make multiple file names reference the same file with hard links and symbolic (or "soft") links.
- Efficiently run commands that affect many files by using pattern matching features of the Bash shell.
