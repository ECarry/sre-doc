## Practical Examples

### Finding Files

```bash
# Find all .conf files in /etc
find /etc -name "*.conf"

# Find files larger than 100MB
find /home -type f -size +100M

# Find files modified in the last 24 hours
find /var/log -type f -mtime -1
```

### Text Processing

```bash
# Find all lines containing "error" in logs
grep -i error /var/log/messages

# Count occurrences of a pattern
grep -c "Failed password" /var/log/secure

# Show the last 100 lines of a log file
tail -n 100 /var/log/messages
```

### Process Management

```bash
# Find process by name
ps aux | grep httpd

# Kill a process by PID
kill 1234

# Kill all processes with a specific name
pkill firefox
```

## Exam Tips

For the RHCSA exam, practice these essential commands thoroughly:

1. Navigation in the filesystem without using graphical tools
2. Creating, viewing, and editing files using vim
3. Finding files and content within files
4. Managing processes
5. Reading and understanding system information

Remember that the RHCSA exam is performance-based, so you'll need to demonstrate practical command-line skills rather than just theory knowledge.
