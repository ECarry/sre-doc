# Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)

The Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) is the highest level of certification in the Red Hat certification program. It represents mastery of enterprise-level technologies and specialized expertise across Red Hat's product portfolio.

1. Hold a current RHCE certification
2. Pass five additional qualifying Red Hat expertise exams

This unique approach allows you to customize your certification path based on your career interests and specialization areas.
