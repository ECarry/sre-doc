This shift reflects the industry's move toward automation and infrastructure as code practices, making the RHCE certification highly relevant for modern IT operations.

## Practice Environment

To prepare for the RHCE exam, set up a lab environment with:

- Multiple RHEL/CentOS/Rocky Linux VMs
- Ansible controller node and multiple managed nodes
- Network connectivity between systems

```yaml
# Example Ansible playbook structure (inventory.yml):
---
all:
  hosts:
    web01:
      ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
    db01:
      ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
  children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        web01:
    dbservers:
      hosts:
        db01:
```

Practice creating playbooks, roles, and templates to automate system configuration across your lab environment.
